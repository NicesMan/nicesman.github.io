* I am currently a postgraduate student at the [Zhejiang University](<https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/>), advised by Prof. [Xinyu Wang](<https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wangxinyu_en#0>). I am also a research intern in [KEG](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/), and my main work is to research the graph neural networks and pre-training task.
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and recommendation system.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Shenzhen University](<https://en.szu.edu.cn/>). My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Joshua Zhexue Huang](<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37081979900>) and Dr. [Yulin He](<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085882087>).
* In my spare time, I like to write techinque sharing notes which can be seen in [zhihu](<https://www.zhihu.com/people/lin-lin-lin-zhu-75/posts>), including statistics, machine learning, recommendation system and so on.
