* I am currently a final year master student at [Zhejiang University](<https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/>), I am also a visiting student in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm), where I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) and Dr. [Yuxiao Dong](https://ericdongyx.github.io/).
* Prior to that, I was a research intern at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by Prof. [Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and Dr. [Xiang Wang](https://xiangwang1223.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.E. from [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/). 
* My research interests revolve around data mining, graph neural networks, self-supervised learning and recommendation system.
